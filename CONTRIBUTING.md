## Development environment

See [README.md](README.md) for build instructions (CMake 3.22+ / C++17 / JUCE 8 fetched automatically by
CMake). Run the unit tests after making changes:

```sh
cmake --build build --target UtawaveTests --config Debug
./build/UtawaveTests_artefacts/Debug/UtawaveTests
```

## Coding guidelines (excerpt)

- C++17. Use JUCE classes and types (`juce::String` / `juce::File`, etc.).
- **Never allocate memory, take locks, or perform I/O on the audio thread.**
- **Wrap end-user-visible text in `tr(u8"...")`** for localization and add the key to the English
  translation table (the key must match exactly, including trailing spaces and newlines).
- **Keep third-party product / library names out of end-user-visible strings**
  (license / attribution files excepted).
